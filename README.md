- 👋 Hi, I’m @justin-hurd
- 👀 I’m interested in CSS, HTML, Javascript, TiddlyWiki, Webcomics, manga, YouTube content, Philosophy, and History.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about TiddlyWiki, and working towards my CompTia A+ qualifications
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything at the moment.
- 📫 you can reach me... Somehow! (I haven't really set up any social media / contacts for use with this haha)
